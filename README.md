## Guide

The code currently contains three applications: 
* The shortest path problem (SP) first introduced by [HKW15](https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2015.1392 "K-Adaptability in Two-Stage Robust Binary Programming")
* The knapsack problem with conflicts (KP), with and without constraint uncertainty, inspired by the capital budgeting from [HKW15](https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2015.1392 "K-Adaptability in Two-Stage Robust Binary Programming")
* The non-linear smuggler problem (Smuggler), inspired by [GR20](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2019.08.012 "On the complexity and approximation of the maximum expected value all-or-nothing subset.") 

Additional applications can be added by creating the corresponding files. To test one of the applications, unzip the corresponding data files, and execute the corresponding run file with julia, passing the instance details as parameters.
